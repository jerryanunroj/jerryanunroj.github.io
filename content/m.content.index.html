	      <h3>About Me</h3>
          	<p> I am currently a research affiliate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Chulalongkorn University. </p>

          	<p> I am fortunate to be mentored by <a href="http://immorlica.com/" target="_blank">Nicole Immorlica</a>. </p>

          	<p> I received my master's degree in Statistics and bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from Harvard University in 2018, where I was advised by <a href="http://yiling.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Yiling Chen</a>. </p>

          	<p> My research interests are at the interface between operations research and economics, especially <i>design and analysis of marketplaces and platforms</i>. In particular, I am interested in social networks, information design, matching markets, stochastic systems, social good, statistics and machine learning. </p>

		  			<b>Computing Equilibria of Prediction Markets via Persuasion </b>  <br>

		  			Jerry Anunrojwong, Yiling Chen, Bo Waggoner and Haifeng Xu <br>

		  			<small> We study the computation of equilibria in prediction markets with two players and three trading opportunities (the "ABA game"). To do so, we show equivalence of prediction market equilibria with those of a simpler signaling game with commitment introduced by Kong and Schoenebeck (2018). We then extend their results by giving computationally efficient algorithms for additional parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a new connection between prediction markets and Bayesian persuasion. </small>

		  			<b>Persuading Risk-Conscious Agents: A Geometric Approach </b>  <br>

		  			Jerry Anunrojwong, Krishnamurthy Iyer and David Lingenbrink <br>

		  			<small> We consider a persuasion problem between a sender and a receiver where the receiver may not be an expected-utility maximizer. That receiver can be a "behavioral" agent (e.g. when a customer is averse to variance in service time) or a "composite" agent (e.g. there are many agents, but the receiver can only commit to a public signaling scheme, so the receiver can treat them all as one). We prove that the sender's problem can be reduced to a convex optimization program and bound the number of signals needed. When the receiver has two possible actions, the problem is reduced to a linear program, which yields a canonical set of signals in the optimal mechanism. </small>

		  		<p> 
		  			<b>Inefficiency-Manipulability Tradeoff in the Parallel Mechanism </b>  <br>

		  			Jerry Anunrojwong <br>

		  			<small> We show the tradeoff between inefficiency and manipulability in school choice with coarse priorities using the parallel mechanism which interpolates between Boston mechanism and Deferred Acceptance. The mechanisms that are closer to Boston are more manipulable and less stable, but also more efficient, both in the worst case and in the typical case. </small>

		  			<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05878" target="_blank"><b>Naive Bayesian Learning in Social Networks </b></a>  <br>

		  			<i>Proceedings of the 2018 ACM Conference on Economics and Computation</i> (EC 2018) <br>

		  			Jerry Anunrojwong, Nat Sothanaphan <br>

		  			<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05878" target="_blank">[arXiv]</a> 
		  			<a href="https://jerryanunroj.github.io/papers/ec18.pdf" target="_blank">[conference]</a> 
		  			<a href="https://jerryanunroj.github.io/slides/ec18_slides.pdf" target="_blank">[slides]</a> <br>

		  			<small> Suppose people talk to their neighbors in a social network and update their beliefs using Bayes' rule locally, but they naively assume that their neighbors are always independent sources of information. We characterize the consensus belief. Agents that are more centrally located and are more confident have more influence over the consensus, and we know precisely how the two factors interact. </small>
