		  			<small> The seller wants to sell an item to n i.i.d. buyers and only the support [a,b] are known; a/b quantifies relative support information (RSI). The seller either minimizes worst-case regret or maximizes worst-case approximation ratio. We show that i) with low RSI, second-price auctions (SPA) is optimal; ii) with high RSI, SPA is not optimal, and we introduce a new mechanism, the "pooling auction" (POOL), which is optimal; iii) with moderate RSI, a combination of SPA and POOL is optimal. Under POOL, whenever the highest value is above a threshold, the mechanism still allocates to the highest bidder (just like SPA), but otherwise the mechanism allocates to a uniformly random buyer, i.e., pools low types. </small>

		  			<small> The seller wants to sell an item to n buyers such that the buyers' valuation distribution is from a given class (i.i.d., mixtures of i.i.d., affiliated and exchangeable, exchangeable, and all distributions) and the seller minimizes worst-case regret. We derive in quasi closed form the minimax values and the associated optimal mechanism. We show that the first three classes admit the same minimax regret, decreasing in n, while the last two have the same minimax regret equal to that of the case n = 1. Across all settings, the optimal mechanisms are second-price auctions with random reserve. </small>

		  			<small> We study the effectiveness of information design in reducing congestion in social services catering to users with varied levels of need. Each arriving user decides either to wait for the service by joining an unobservable FCFS queue, or to leave and get her outside option. To reduce congestion, the service provider seeks to share partial information about the current queue length to persuade more low-need users to leave, thereby better serving high-need users. We show that with enough heterogeneity in need, information design not only Pareto dominates full-info and no-info mechanisms, in some regimes it achieves the same welfare as the "first-best". </small>

		  			<small> We consider a persuasion problem between a sender and a receiver where the receiver may not be an expected-utility maximizer. We prove that the sender's problem can be reduced to a convex optimization program and bound the number of signals needed. When the receiver has two possible actions, the problem is reduced to a linear program, which yields a canonical set of signals in the optimal mechanism. </small>

		  			Ozan Candogan, Nicole Immorlica, Bar Light and Jerry Anunrojwong <br>

		  			Major Revision at <i>Operations Research</i>. <br>

		  			<small> We introduce an opinion dynamics model where agents are connected in a social network, and repeatedly update their opinions based on the content shown to them by the platform's personalized recommendation and their neighbors' opinions. We prove that agents always converge to some limiting opinion, which can be categorized into two groups: extreme consensus where all agents agree on an extreme opinion, and persistent disagreement where agents disagree. We analyze the relationship between extremism and polarization in terms of the strength of the platform's influence and initial opinions. </small>

		  			Jerry Anunrojwong, Yiling Chen, Bo Waggoner and Haifeng Xu <br>

		  			<i>Proceedings of the Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE), </i> 2019. <br>

		  			<small> We study the computation of equilibria in prediction markets with two players and three trading opportunities (the "ABA game"). To do so, we show equivalence of prediction market equilibria with those of a simpler signaling game with commitment introduced by Kong and Schoenebeck (2018). We then extend their results by giving computationally efficient algorithms for additional parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a new connection between prediction markets and Bayesian persuasion. </small>

		  			<i>Workshop on Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG) 2019</i> <br>

		  			Jerry Anunrojwong <br>

		  			<small> We show the tradeoff between inefficiency and manipulability in school choice with coarse priorities using the parallel mechanism which interpolates between Boston mechanism and Deferred Acceptance. The mechanisms that are closer to Boston are more manipulable and less stable, but also more efficient, both in the worst case and in the typical case. </small>

		  			<small> Suppose people talk to their neighbors in a social network and update their beliefs using Bayes' rule locally, but they naively assume that their neighbors are always independent sources of information. We characterize the consensus belief. Agents that are more centrally located and are more confident have more influence over the consensus, and we know precisely how the two factors interact. </small>
