	      <h3>About Me</h3>
          	<p> I am currently a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty-research/divisions/decision-risk-operations" target="_blank">Decision, Risk, and Operations Division</a> of the <a href="https://home.gsb.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Graduate School of Business</a> at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank">Columbia University</a>. </p>

          	<p> Before my PhD, I was a data scientist at Agoda, and a research affiliate at MIT and Chulalongkorn University. </p>

          	<p> I received my master's degree in Statistics and bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from Harvard University in 2018, where I was advised by <a href="http://yiling.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Yiling Chen</a>. </p>

          	<p> I am interested in mechanism design, market design, resource allocation problems, data-driven decision making, and causal inference. I have also worked on information design and social learning. </p>

		  			<small> We study the effectiveness of information design in reducing congestion in social services catering to users with varied levels of need. Each arriving user decides either to wait for the service by joining an unobservable FCFS queue, or to leave and get her outside option. To reduce congestion, the service provider seeks to share partial information about the current queue length to persuade more low-need users to leave, thereby better serving high-need users. We show that with enough heterogeneity in need, information design not only Pareto dominates full-info and no-info mechanisms, in some regimes it achieves the same welfare as the "first-best". </small>

		  			<i>Workshop on Behavioral EC,</i> 2019. <br>

		  			<small> We consider a persuasion problem between a sender and a receiver where the receiver may not be an expected-utility maximizer. We prove that the sender's problem can be reduced to a convex optimization program and bound the number of signals needed. When the receiver has two possible actions, the problem is reduced to a linear program, which yields a canonical set of signals in the optimal mechanism. </small>

		  			Jerry Anunrojwong, Ozan Candogan and Nicole Immorlica <br>

		  			Major Revision at <i>Management Science</i>. <br>

		  			<small> we introduce an opinion dynamics model where agents are connected in a social network, and repeatedly update their opinions based on the content shown to them by the platform's personalized recommendation and their neighbors' opinions. We prove that agents always converge to some limiting opinion, which can be categorized into two groups: extreme consensus where all agents agree on an extreme opinion, and persistent disagreement where agents disagree. We analyze the relationship between extremism and polarization in terms of the strength of the platform's influence and initial opinions. </small>

		  			Jerry Anunrojwong, Yiling Chen, Bo Waggoner and Haifeng Xu <br>

		  			<i>Proceedings of the Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE), </i> 2019. <br>

		  			<small> We study the computation of equilibria in prediction markets with two players and three trading opportunities (the "ABA game"). To do so, we show equivalence of prediction market equilibria with those of a simpler signaling game with commitment introduced by Kong and Schoenebeck (2018). We then extend their results by giving computationally efficient algorithms for additional parameter regimes. Our approach leverages a new connection between prediction markets and Bayesian persuasion. </small>

		  			<i>Workshop on Mechanism Design for Social Good (MD4SG) 2019</i> <br>

		  			Jerry Anunrojwong <br>

		  			<small> We show the tradeoff between inefficiency and manipulability in school choice with coarse priorities using the parallel mechanism which interpolates between Boston mechanism and Deferred Acceptance. The mechanisms that are closer to Boston are more manipulable and less stable, but also more efficient, both in the worst case and in the typical case. </small>

		  			<small> Suppose people talk to their neighbors in a social network and update their beliefs using Bayes' rule locally, but they naively assume that their neighbors are always independent sources of information. We characterize the consensus belief. Agents that are more centrally located and are more confident have more influence over the consensus, and we know precisely how the two factors interact. </small>
