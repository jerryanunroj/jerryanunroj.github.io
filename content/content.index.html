	      <h3>About Me</h3>
          	<p> I am currently a research affiliate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Chulalongkorn University. </p>

          	<p> I am fortunate to be mentored by <a href="http://immorlica.com/" target="_blank">Nicole Immorlica</a>. </p>

          	<p> I received my master's degree in Statistics and bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics from Harvard University in 2018, where I was advised by <a href="http://yiling.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Yiling Chen</a>. </p>

          	<p> My research interests are at the interface between economics and computation. I am particularly interested in information and signaling in games, social networks, and matching markets. </p>

		  			<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05878" target="_blank"><b>Naive Bayesian Learning in Social Networks </b></a> (EC 2018)  <br>

		  			Jerry Anunrojwong, Nat Sothanaphan <br>

		  			<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05878" target="_blank">[arXiv]</a>

		  			<small> Suppose people talk to their neighbors in a social network and update their beliefs using Bayes' rule locally, but they naively assume that their neighbors are always independent sources of information. We characterize the consensus belief. Agents that are more centrally located and are more confident have more influence over the consensus, and we know precisely how the two factors interact. </small>

		  			<small> We characterize information structures and design prediction markets that are immune to manipulation by forward-looking strategic traders, using convex analysis and linear programming. </small>
